# Lab | Neural Networks

## Introduction

This lab will let you practice performing neural network analysis. It will also introduce you additional concepts in neural network analysis and Tensorflow. You will be introduced to a web tool called [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org) with which you can play with and learn about the hyperparameters of Tensorflow.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

Install the required Python packages by running:

**For macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):**
```bash
pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

**For other systems (Windows, Linux, Intel Mac):**
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

> **Note:** The notebook automatically detects your system and installs the correct TensorFlow version.

Alternatively, if you're using a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (choose based on your system)
# For Apple Silicon Mac:
pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
# For other systems:
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Getting Started

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (see Installation section above)
2. Navigate to the `your-code` directory
3. Open `challenge-1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run cells sequentially from top to bottom
5. Complete Challenge 1 and 2 following the instructions in the notebooks

## Deliverables

- `challenge-1.ipynb` containing your responses.
- Screenshot of your Tensorflow Playground experiment for Challenge 2.
<!-- - [OPTIONAL] `bonus.ipynb` containing your responses. -->

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
